- 👋 Hi, I’m @arielfcotrim
- 👀 I’m interested in tech, music (classic, blues, rock and metal mainly), meat and lifting really heavy weights!
- 🌱 I’m currently a QA & Integration Engineer at Microsoft Israel and I'm learning DevSecOps at Bar-Ilan University. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding projects, devops projects and industry knowledge in general.
